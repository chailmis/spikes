        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Checks that the manifest specifies a targetSdkVersion that is recent"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

        message="Old buildToolsVersion; recommended version is 19.0.2 or later"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Looks for old or obsolete Gradle library dependencies"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

    <issue
        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Should explicitly set android:allowBackup to true or false (it&apos;s true by default, and that can have some security implications for the application&apos;s data)"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application&apos;s manifest"
        explanation="The allowBackup attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`"
